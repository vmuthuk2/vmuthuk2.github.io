Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in the [FREEDM System Center](https://www.freedm.ncsu.edu) and [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ece.ncsu.edu) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu). I will also graduate with a **Ph.D. minor** in **statistics**. I specialize in power system with a focus on operation and control of smart grids. I earned my master degree in Electrical Engineering from [North Carolina State University](https://ww.ncsu.edu) as well and my B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [National Institute of Technology, Trichy](https://www.nitt.edu).

My research explores the difficulties and possible solutions to restore smart distribution systems with high renewable penetration after extreme outages using microgrids. I also have expertise in smart meter data analytics and data-driven operation of power systems.
